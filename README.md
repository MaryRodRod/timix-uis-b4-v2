The evocation of a time has always attracted attention, for this reason our purpose is to satisfy the need to seek to collect those pleasant experiences typical of the time, its fashion, its culture. We wish to fulfill the objective of finding the solution of providing our own tools so that the user can fulfill the desire of their clients to remember a particular time and specialize in their musical preferences.
